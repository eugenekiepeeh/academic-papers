# academic-papers
Repository containing academic coursework and research projects in advanced statistical modeling and econometrics. Includes regression modeling, Generalized Linear Models, and applied statistical studies focused on real-world datasets and interpretability. These are papers I have completed with others in some cases for a coursework.
